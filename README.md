```lrc
[00:17.75] You say it's all in my head
[00:21.64] And the things I think just don't make sense
[00:25.99] So where you been then? Don't go all coy
[00:30.24] Don't turn it round on me like it's my fault
[00:34.71] See I can see that look in your eyes
[00:39.09] The one that shoots me each and every time (each and every time)
[01:11.09] 
[00:43.15] You grace me with your cold shoulder
[00:47.82] Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
[00:51.82] You shower me with words made of knives
[00:56.44] Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
[01:16.44] 
[01:10.18] These days when I see you
[01:14.14] You make it look like I'm see-through
[01:18.48] Do tell me why you waste our time
[01:22.74] When your heart ain't in it, and you're not satisfied
[01:27.14] You know I know just how you feel
[01:31.49] I'm starting to find myself feeling that way too
[01:55.49] 
[01:34.99] When you grace me with your cold shoulder
[01:40.15] Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
[01:44.34] You shower me with words made of knives
[01:48.81] Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
[02:08.81] 
[01:54.13] Time and time again, I play the role of fool
[01:57.16] (Just for you)
[01:58.75] Even in the daylight when you think that
[02:01.15] (I don't see you)
[02:02.80] Try to look for things I hear but our eyes never find
[02:07.16] Though I do know how you play
[02:21.66] 
[02:10.41] You grace me with your cold shoulder
[02:15.19] Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
[02:19.26] You shower me with words made of knives
[02:23.88] Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
[02:43.88] 
[02:28.17] You grace me with your cold shoulder
[02:32.52] Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
[02:36.62] You shower me with words made of knives
[02:41.37] Whenever you look at me I wish I was her, eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh
